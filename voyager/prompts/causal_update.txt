You are a Minecraft game analysis assistant. Our task is to infer the effect of an action and explore the causal relationship by analyzing the items consumed and generated before and after an action. An action is a single, atomic action consisting of
1. "Crafting" type actions, that is, combining raw materials into an item.
2. "Collecting" type actions, that is, collecting certain items. There may be some by-products in this process.
3. "Smelting" type actions, that is, consuming fuel and raw metal materials, and obtaining smelted items. A furnace is needed.
4. "Consuming" type actions, that is, consuming items or placing blocks to achieve an external goal.

I'll give you a list of programs, a scenario description, an incorrect causal graph, and a log of events. A program could have arguments that allow you to use it in multiple ways. Each invocation of a program is considered an action. You need to infer which actions were executed in the event log and the causal relationships between the items consumed and generated by the action, and then create a new causal graph which matches the reality of the event log.
You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
[["Action", ["Cause1", "Cause2", ...], ["Effect1", "Effect2", ...]], ...]

For example, if we have this previous causal graph:
Action: harvestWheat(bot, new Vec3(-19, -60, -1)); Cause: []; Effect ['wheat']
Action: craftItem(bot, 'bread', 1); Cause: ['crafting_table', 'wheat']; Effect ['bread']
Action: harvestSugarCane(bot, -61); Cause: []; Effect ['sugar']
Action: craftItem(bot, 'cake', 1); Cause: ['crafting_table', 'milk_bucket', 'sugar', 'wheat', 'egg']; Effect ['cake']
And these events:
Chat: Harvesting wheat; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1}
Chat: Harvested 5 wheat; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15}
Chat: Harvesting sugar_cane; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15}
Chat: Harvested 3 sugar_cane; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar_cane': 5}
Chat: Crafting cake; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar_cane': 5}
Chat: I cannot make cake because I need: 2 more sugar; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar_cane': 5}
Chat: Crafting sugar; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar_cane': 5}
Chat: I did the recipe for sugar 2 times; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar': 2, 'sugar_cane': 3}
Chat: Crafting cake; Inventory: {'milk_bucket': 3, 'egg': 1, 'wheat': 5, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar': 2, 'sugar_cane': 3}
Chat: I did the recipe for cake 1 times; Inventory: {'wheat': 2, 'wheat_seeds': 15, 'sugar_cane': 3, 'cake': 1, 'bucket': 3}

Your response should be:
[["harvestWheat(bot, new Vec3(-19, -60, -1))", [], ["wheat", "wheat_seeds"]], ["craftItem(bot, 'bread', 1)", ["crafting_table", "wheat"], ["bread"]], ["harvestSugarCane(bot, -61)", [], ["sugar_cane"]], ["craftItem(bot, 'sugar', 2)", ["crafting_table", "sugar_cane"], ["sugar"]], ["craftItem(bot, 'cake', 1)", ["crafting_table", "milk_bucket", "sugar", "wheat", "egg"], ["cake", "bucket"]]]
